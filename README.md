# Blog  

### A blog where I share thoughts on tech, coding, and open source.  

#### Technologies Used  
This website was built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS** for quick responsive styling, and **React Markdown** for rendering blog posts written in Markdown format.  

#### Adding a New Post  
Adding a new post is extremely easy! I simply write a new post in a note-taking app (such as Notion), export it to **Markdown (.md)**, add that `.md` file to this repo, and update `posts.js` with the post's metadata (title, description, etc.). Everything else is **automatically handled** by the website!  

#### What's next?  
- Making a logo for the blog  

###### Originally, I made this blog web app using vanilla JS, then I had fun migrating it to React in just two days!  
###### But then I realized how beneficial server-side rendering would be for SEO, so in just under 11 hours, I migrated the app to Next.js and moved hosting from GitHub Pages to Vercel.
