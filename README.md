# Blog  

### A blog where I share thoughts on tech, coding, and open source.  

#### Technologies Used  
This website was built using **React**, with **Vite** for fast building, **Bootstrap** for quick responsive styling, **HashRouter** (React Router) to ensure proper routing on GitHub Pages, and **React Markdown** for rendering blog posts written in Markdown format.  

#### Adding a New Post  
Adding a new post is a breeze! Simply write a new post in a note-taking app (such as Notion), export it to **Markdown (.md)**, add that `.md` file to this repo, and update `posts.js` with the post's metadata (title, description, etc.). Everything else is **automatically handled** by the website!

#### What's next?
- Reimplementing the client side search feature
- Making a logo for the blog
###### This was my first-ever experience using React, and it only took me two days to migrate this blog website from Vanilla to React.
